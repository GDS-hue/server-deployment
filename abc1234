Create the branch, commit something (optional), then set upstream on push:

git checkout -b staging
git push --set-upstream origin staging


Equivalent to git push -u.

✅ WAY 2 — Create branch and set upstream in a single command (without switching)
git branch staging
git push -u origin staging


You create the branch but don’t switch to it until needed.

✅ WAY 3 — Use git checkout --track to auto-configure upstream

If the branch already exists on remote and you want to track it:

git checkout --track origin/staging


If it doesn’t exist yet, you can create & publish it like this:

git checkout -b staging
git push origin staging
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/staging


If you want, I can also show GitHub Desktop, VS Code, or GitHub UI methods.
